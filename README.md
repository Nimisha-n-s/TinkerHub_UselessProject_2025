Project Description
This project is a fun and creative computer vision application that detects and maps the positions of scattered bread crumbs in real time using a phoneâ€™s camera as an IP webcam. The live video feed is processed with OpenCV to convert each frame to grayscale and apply thresholding to highlight dark crumbs on a light background. Contours are detected to identify individual crumbs, their centers are marked with green dots, and then randomly connected with blue lines to create a unique breadcrumb trail map. The number of detected crumbs is displayed live on the video feed along with a custom project title. This project demonstrates the basics of video streaming, image processing, contour detection, and drawing with OpenCV, making it a playful experiment for beginners in computer vision and Python programming.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody needs to map bread crumbs, but we did it anyway.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We point a camera at crumbs and draw silly lines between them for no real reason.
