# [Crumbs mapper] üéØ

### Project Description
This project is a fun and creative computer vision application that detects and maps the positions of scattered bread crumbs in real time using a phone‚Äôs camera as an IP webcam. The live video feed is processed with OpenCV to convert each frame to grayscale and apply thresholding to highlight dark crumbs on a light background. Contours are detected to identify individual crumbs, their centers are marked with green dots, and then randomly connected with blue lines to create a unique breadcrumb trail map. The number of detected crumbs is displayed live on the video feed along with a custom project title. This project demonstrates the basics of video streaming, image processing, contour detection, and drawing with OpenCV, making it a playful experiment for beginners in computer vision and Python programming.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody needs to map bread crumbs, but we did it anyway

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We point a camera at crumbs and draw silly lines between them for no real reason.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [Languages used:Python]
- [Frameworks used: OpenCV, random]
- [Libraries used]
- [Tools used:IP Webcam app (to stream phone camera)]

For Hardware:
- [List main components:Smartphone (as IP camera)]
- [List specifications:Phone with camera + internet connection]
- [List tools required:Computer with Python installed, stable Wi-Fi network]

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
# Install OpenCV
pip install opencv-python


# Run
Set up your phone:
Install the IP Webcam app from the Play Store (or any similar app).
Open the app, start the camera server, and note the IP address and port (e.g., http://192.168.x.x:8080/video).
Make sure your phone and computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

# Run your Python script
python filename.py
